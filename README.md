## start using it
```
npm init
npm i express nodemon
```
## Important notes
```
- Does not include the Big Buck Bunny Video, since its too big for GitHub
- You can download Your own on this site : http://bbb3d.renderfarming.net/download.html
- Just Download it with the Resolution You prefer and add it to the project folder
- And in the endrename it, mine was named bbb.mp4
```
## Future plans
- Update the app to work with MongoDB and take the video from there and stream
